  The folder "movies-on-tip" consits of 2 sub-folders:
      
      1. frontend/movie-manager - Display + Logic of application
      
      2. backend/server - Backend server for fetching and storing details of the movies which is a Json database server
      
    
   Also I have included a .env file with REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL = http://localhost:3001
